# EECE 490 Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict solar flare intensity using machine learning models trained on features extracted from magnetogram images of solar active regions.
Solar flares are categorized into four main classes based on their X-ray brightness: C, M, X, and 0 (no flare).
Our objective is to identify patterns in solar magnetic data that help forecast flare strength accurately.
